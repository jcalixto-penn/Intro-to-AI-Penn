      <h1>Group Exercises</h1>
      <p>
        These weekly activities help you apply core AI concepts in small teams. Each exercise builds
        intuition about how AI systems learn, generate, and reason — and encourages reflection on their
        impact in the real world. Unless noted otherwise, submit the brief notes requested in each exercise.

    <!-- Lecture 1 -->
    <section class="section-card" id="lec1">
      <h2>Lecture 1: Reverse Turing Test</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Form groups of 3 and spend 5 minutes telling each other two things about yourself. Pick a letter: A, B, or C.</li>
        <li>
          Student A asks a question. Student B writes a two-sentence response on an index card.
          In parallel, Student C asks an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT or Claude) to role-play Student B and answers the same question.
          Student C writes the model’s two-sentence response. Both responses are anonymized and given to Student A.
        </li>
        <li>Student A guesses which response is from Student B. Student B’s goal is to mimic the LLM and fool A.</li>
        <li>If time permits, rotate roles so each student plays A, B, and C.</li>
        <li>Reflect on strategies that worked or didn’t for both Students A and C.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="muted">Only written note (if requested): your role — A, B, or C.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Lecture 2 -->
    <section class="section-card" id="lec2">
      <h2>Lecture 2: Train a Classifier</h2>
      <p>
        Use <a href="https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teachable Machine’s image classifier</a>.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Form groups of 2 students.</li>
        <li>Train a model to classify images of two objects. Record accuracy for each task/class.</li>
        <li>Degrade its performance by ~20% (e.g., rotate or partially block the objects).</li>
        <li>Retrain the model more robustly (e.g., include more orientations and background variation during training).</li>
        <li>
          Reflection: Did inadvertent human faces confuse the model? What helped robustness more — more data or more variation?
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Lecture 3 -->
    <section class="section-card" id="lec3">
      <h2>Lecture 3: AI Buzzwords</h2>
      <p>We played “What’s that AI buzzword?” Select <strong>three</strong> terms below and give examples illustrating each idea.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Teaching a model to put things into categories (e.g., spam vs. not spam).</li>
        <li><strong>Supervised learning:</strong> Training with labeled examples where the right answers are already known (e.g., images labeled Apple vs. Strawberry).</li>
        <li><strong>Overfitting:</strong> When a model memorizes training data and performs poorly on new data due to irrelevant learned features.</li>
        <li><strong>Unsupervised learning:</strong> Finding hidden patterns in data without labels (e.g., grouping similar songs).</li>
        <li><strong>Test data:</strong> A separate set for checking generalization (e.g., predicting rent for a new apartment).</li>
        <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> The model’s output on unseen inputs (e.g., the rent estimate for a new apartment).</li>
        <li><strong>Neural network:</strong> Interconnected nodes inspired by the brain that learn patterns from data; input layer ingests data, output layer produces results.</li>
        <li><strong>Large Language Model (LLM):</strong> Trained on huge text corpora to generate/understand language (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude).</li>
        <li><strong>Deep learning:</strong> Machine learning with many neural layers capturing complex patterns for prediction/classification.</li>
        <li><strong>Reinforcement learning:</strong> Training via trial and error with rewards/penalties; reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes LLMs.</li>
        <li><strong>Features / Variables:</strong> Measurable inputs used by models (e.g., square footage, bedrooms).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Lecture 4 -->
    <section class="section-card" id="lec4">
      <h2>Lecture 4: You Are the LLM</h2>
      <p>At each table, complete the prompt: <em>“In the future people will…”</em></p>
      <ol>
        <li>One person starts by adding the next word. Go around the table adding one word (or punctuation) at a time until time is called.</li>
        <li>
          Use words from this vocabulary plus any articles (a, an, the), prepositions (of, in, at, to, with…), or punctuation (, ; .):<br>
          <code>
            live, then, travel, explore, and, so, create, build, learn, teach, share, connect, change,
            dream, imagine, fly, work, together, if, everywhere, moon, Mars, Earth, ocean, because,
            faster, better, happily, safely, freely, while
          </code>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Discuss:</strong> How different were the responses at different tables, and why? In what ways did your prompt completion differ from modern LLMs?</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Lecture 5 -->
    <section class="section-card" id="lec5">
      <h2>Lecture 5: Word Embeddings for Real</h2>
      <p>
        Use this Colab notebook (by Prof. Chris Callison-Burch; added visualization content by Ha):

      <ol>
        <li>Click the link (requires a Google account). It opens in a new browser tab.</li>
        <li>Run each cell. If you have trouble, let us know.</li>
        <li>Vary the questions and discuss the responses/visualizations.</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="muted">Submission: mark <em>Yes</em> for attendance only.</p>

    <!-- Lecture 6 -->
    <section class="section-card" id="lec6">
      <h2>Lecture 6: Good Prompting</h2>
      <p>
        Create prompts that help with your studies, professional, or personal life.
        For inspiration, see these examples:
        <a href="https://chatgpt.com/use-cases/students" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prompt ideas for students</a>.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Explore the examples; then craft your own prompts.</li>
        <li>Try at least one prompt (optionally include the response).</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Lecture 7 -->
    <section class="section-card" id="lec7">
      <h2>Lecture 7: Make Your Own Loss Function</h2>
      <p>
        We discussed training neural nets to reduce a <em>loss function</em> via gradient descent until performance is “good enough.”
        With your group, choose a real-life goal and define a loss function that would help you achieve that goal.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">Example: To forecast tomorrow's temperature T, minimize <code>(predicted T − measured T)<sup>2</sup></code>.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Lecture 10 -->
    <section class="section-card" id="lec10">
      <h2>Lecture 10: What Can You Do with AI?</h2>
      <p>
        Build something with AI for a task you genuinely know how to do, aimed at a real user (friend, younger student, teammate).
        Go beyond text — ask for drawings, videos, or demos where appropriate.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong> a favorite recipe; coaching tips (tennis, photography composition, pottery); a still-life sketch; relationship advice; a day itinerary for a visiting friend.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Plan (10 min):</strong> Map a strategy to maximize AI — background info to supply, prompt sequence, external tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Discuss (15 min):</strong> Share your plan with the group and get feedback.</li>
        <li><strong>Build (15 min):</strong> Try with a minimal prompt; then iterate with all the ingredients you think will produce the best outcome.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="section-card">
      <h2>Guidelines</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Groups typically consist of 3-5 students (unless otherwise specified).</li>
        <li>Participation counts toward attendance and engagement.</li>
        <li>Be prepared to share a short summary of your discussion or findings at the end of class.</li>
        <li>When using AI tools, cite them clearly in any submissions.</li>
      </ul>
